\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a revised quantum field theory (QFT) framework that operates below the Planck scale, addressing the necessary modifications to standard QFT in this extreme regime. The study explores how these modifications impact mass generation mechanisms and quantum gravity, offering predictions for potential observable effects.

\section{Introduction}
Conventional quantum field theory (QFT) has been highly successful in describing fundamental interactions, yet it faces significant challenges when applied to scales at or below the Planck length. This paper seeks to extend QFT into the sub-Planck scale, modifying key aspects of the theory to account for the unique conditions that arise in this regime.

\section{Modified Field Equations}

\subsection{Quantum Corrections at Sub-Planck Scales}
At sub-Planck scales, quantum corrections to the field equations become dominant, necessitating a revision of the energy-momentum tensor and the metrics of space-time. These corrections introduce new terms that can significantly alter the behavior of fields and particles in this extreme regime.

\subsection{Non-Linear Interactions}
The introduction of non-linear interaction terms, which are typically negligible at larger scales, becomes crucial at sub-Planck scales. These interactions can lead to phenomena such as self-interacting fields and the emergence of new, non-perturbative effects that are absent in standard QFT.

\subsection{Higher-Order Operators}
Higher-order derivative operators must be included in the Lagrangian when extending QFT to sub-Planck scales. These operators modify the propagation of particles and fields, leading to changes in dispersion relations and the potential emergence of novel quantum states.

\section{Mass Generation Mechanisms}

\subsection{Conventional Mass Generation in QFT}
In standard QFT, mass is typically generated through mechanisms such as the Higgs mechanism, where particles acquire mass by interacting with a scalar field. However, these mechanisms are based on assumptions that may not hold at sub-Planck scales.

\subsection{Mass Generation in Sub-Planck QFT}
When applying the modified QFT framework to sub-Planck scales, the conventional mass generation mechanisms are altered. New mass terms may arise from the additional interaction terms and higher-order operators, potentially leading to the discovery of new particles or exotic states of matter.

\subsection{Implications for Quantum Gravity}
These modifications have profound implications for our understanding of quantum gravity. By altering the fundamental nature of mass at sub-Planck scales, this framework may provide new insights into the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

\section{Predictions and Observable Consequences}

\subsection{Quantum Field Behavior at Sub-Planck Scales}
Under the revised QFT framework, quantum fields are expected to exhibit behavior that deviates significantly from standard predictions. These deviations may manifest as new scattering amplitudes, shifts in particle lifetimes, or changes in the behavior of vacuum fluctuations.

\subsection{Experimental Tests}
To validate these predictions, experimental tests could be conducted using high-energy particle accelerators or through cosmological observations of the early universe. Such tests may reveal the presence of the predicted non-linear effects or new particles that arise from the modified QFT framework.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper has presented a modified quantum field theory framework for sub-Planck scales, addressing the necessary changes to field equations, mass generation mechanisms, and their implications for quantum gravity. Future work should focus on further refining this framework and exploring its potential integration into a unified theory of quantum gravity.
